-In this query I wanted to to retrieve of the account numbers, number of orders, products, quantity, price, orderdates and locations of orders that
where made in the month of February.

SELECT c.acctnum, COUNT(c.order_id) AS 'Count of OrderIDs', f.Product, f.Quantity, f.price, f.orderdate, f.location
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
GROUP BY c.acctnum, f.Product, f.Quantity, f.price, f.orderdate, f.location
